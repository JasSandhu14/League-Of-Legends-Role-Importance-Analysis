# League of Legends: Role Importance Analysis
Author: Jas Sandhu

## Introduction
League of Legends (LoL) is a popular online multiplayer game released by Riot Games. The gameplay consists of two teams of five players, each with a unique role, as they attempt to destroy the enemy team's base, known as the Nexus. With over 150 playable characters, each player has one of five roles: top, jungle, middle, bottom, or support, which all serve different purposes throughout the game. With the mass popularity of the game, debates have sparked for which role is considered the most important, which is what I hope to gain insight into with this project.

### The Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the [2024 League of Legends Esports Stats dataset]() provided by Oracle's Elixir which includes data from professional League of Legends matches across the world. The data includes 117576 rows and 161 columns. The following table shows the most important columns to the analysis.

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis
### Data Cleaning
For ease of analysis, only the columns that were relevant to the analysis were kept leaving us with 23 columns. Additionally, rows were split according to the individual players stats and collective team stats for each game. Since I am interested in analyzing individual performance, I removed all rows that were not on player data. In other words, I removed all rows that contained collective team data. The `result` column was also changed to booleans, where `True` means the player won and `False` means the player lost, making it easier to understand. Similar alterations were made to `firstbloodkill`, `firstbloodassist`, and `firstbloodvictim`, making it easier to read first blood data. After cleaning, the dataset contains 97980 rows and 23 columns. 

### Univariate Analysis

It should be noted that some characters are used more often than others, which may result in some skewed data, as some champions may perform better at certain statistics.

### Bivariate Analysis
Bivariate analysis on the distribution of kills + assists, damage per minute, and earned gold per minute.

Bottom and Mid Laners have a clear advantage in this regard, with support and jungle having a clear disadvantage. At first glance it seems as though bottom and mid laners are more influential in this regard. 

I then decided to do another analysis on earned gold per minute, as it seems there is a disparity between the damage certain roles have inflict.

As this graph shows, there is a similar trend in the earned gold per minute as there was in the damage per minute. This implies that there is a connection between a role's ability to earn gold and inflict damage, which makes sense as gold is commonly earned by killing champions and minions.

Finally, I decided to look at the number of kills + assists per role to see if this trend continues.

However, it seems as though all roles are relatively similar in this regard. This implies that the roles that were unable to inflict a lot of damage makes up for it by assisting and participating in kills.

### Interesting Aggregates
According to the trends spotted in the bivariate analysis, I decided to calculate the mean of various statistics grouped according each role.

| position   |    kills |   deaths |   assists |     dpm |   damagemitigatedperminute |    vspm |   earned gpm |   minionkills |   monsterkills |
|:-----------|---------:|---------:|----------:|--------:|---------------------------:|--------:|-------------:|--------------:|---------------:|
| bot        | 4.604    |  2.57981 |   5.73648 | 682.659 |                    310.231 | 1.207   |      303.178 |      265.932  |      12.7384   |
| jng        | 2.78205  |  3.17381 |   7.98122 | 407.086 |                    999.555 | 1.41025 |      218.78  |       24.44   |     163.637    |
| mid        | 3.93876  |  2.7154  |   5.9729  | 683.593 |                    419.706 | 1.10782 |      290.626 |      267.454  |       9.42131  |
| sup        | 0.920851 |  3.63411 |   9.88982 | 204.696 |                    619.754 | 3.28185 |      126.039 |       42.5094 |       0.291029 |
| top        | 2.87513  |  3.0494  |   5.20407 | 552.316 |                   1010.86  | 0.95972 |      256.543 |      239.654  |       6.71928  |

From the aggregated table, our suspicion was correct as jungle and support have a higher average assists than every other role. Our analysis also shows that these roles have lower average minion kills, possibly influencing the earned gold per minute from before. At first glance, while it may seem that bottom and mid lane may be the most important, the other positions influence the game in different ways. Top lane and jungle have the highest mean damage mitigated per minute, support has the highest average vision score per minute, and jungle has a large advantage for average monster kills.

## Assessment of Missingness
### NMAR Analysis
From the original dataset, `ban5` is a column that showed the 5th champion that was banned from the game. In the professional Leauge of Legends games, both teams have an opportunity to ban five champions from the other team. I believe that this column is not missing at random (NMAR) as I could not point out a pattern in the missingness of the data. I reason that some teams purposely decided not to ban a fifth champion, which would make the missing data point dependent on the actual value of the missing data point itself. To make this column missing at random (MAR), a new column that checks to see if the total number of bans were used can provide more insight into the missing data point. 

### Missingness Dependency
In the dataset, `damagemitigatedperminute` has a some missing values. I'm going to test if the missingness of these values is dependes on other columns, in particular, `datacompleteness` and `position`. The significance level I chose for both tests is 0.05 and test statistic is Total Variation Distance (TVD).

**Null Hypothesis**: Distribution of datacompleteness when damagemitigated is missing is the same as the distribution of datacompleteness when damagemitigated is not missing.

**Alternative Hypothesis**: Distribution of datacompleteness when damagemitigated is missing is NOT the same as the distribution of datacompleteness when damagemitigated is not missing.

Below is the observed distribution of `datacompleteness` when `damagemitigatedperminute` is missing and not missing.

| datacompleteness   |   missing=False |   missing=True |
|:-------------------|----------------:|---------------:|
| complete           |       1         |      0         |
| partial            |       0         |      1         |

It is clear that the missingess of `damagemitigatedperminute` depends on datacompleteness but I will perform a permutation test to make sure. From our permutation test, the observed TVD is 1.0 and the p-value for the test is 0.0.

Since the p-value is less than the significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, meaning that the missingness of `damagemitigatedperminute` is dependent on `datacompleteness`. 

The second permutation test is on the `position` column with the same missingness column `damagemitigatedperminute`.

**Null Hypothesis**: Distribution of position when damagemitigated is missing is the same as the distribution of position when damagemitigated is not missing.

**Alternative Hypothesis**: Distribution of position when damagemitigated is missing is NOT the same as the distribution of position when damagemitigated is not missing.

Below is the observed distributino of `position` when `damagemitigatedperminute` is missing and not missing.

| position   |   missing=False |   missing=True |
|:-----------|----------------:|---------------:|
| bot        |             0.2 |            0.2 |
| jng        |             0.2 |            0.2 |
| mid        |             0.2 |            0.2 |
| sup        |             0.2 |            0.2 |
| top        |             0.2 |            0.2 |

Once again, off first glance, the data seems to be straightforward but I'll perform permutation test again to ensure this. From the permuation test, the observed TVD is 0.0 and I got a p-value of 1.0.

Since the p-value is greater than the significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning that the missingness of `damagemitigatedperminute` is not dependent on `position`.

## Hypothesis Testing
After cleaning and exploring the data, I decided to see if all roles have the same impact.

**Null Hypothesis**: All roles have the same impact
**Alternative Hypothesis**: All roles do not have the same impact

For my hypothesis test, the test statistic I used was Total Variation Distance (TVD) with a significance level of 0.05, which is commonly used to test statistical significance. TVD was used in the scenario since I'm comparing categorical distributions of the different positions. 

I ran three seperate tests, on `kills + assists`, `damage per minute`, and `earned gold per minute`.
